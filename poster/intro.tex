In recent years, the development of image analysis technology using deep learning (DL) has been remarkable and research on histopathological imaging has been very successful.  On the other hand, there are few opportunities to actually use the technique and its products in clinical diagnostic practice. Because several steps must be taken to obtain inferential results from DL on histopathological images. For example, to use DL system you may need to take photograph, move the image files to an external storage, walk to physically separated room where DL system places and analyze the images by DL. Because of somthing hassle like them, DL are rarely used directly in clinical practice. \par

In this study, We propose a system that integrate seamlessly microscope and DL system for clinical diagnostics using Raspberry Pi.\par
